# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

The purpose of this repo is to store files for the homework assignment 2 for the UT coding boot camp.

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

### Notes

I found this assignment to be very difficult and time consuming, but I think I learned a lot along the way. I had trouble making the text behave the way it was supposed to on the about me page, but I think everything else works to a reasonable degree. 

I acidentally deleted all of my homework 2 files late Monday night and had to re-do the whole assignment from scratch. I would have liked to have more time to make the code a little cleaner and the pages look a little nicer, as well as leave more extensive comments in the code, but I was rushed and did most of this in one day.
